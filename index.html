    <p>&quot; The University of Lethbridge maintained its top-three position in the   Maclean&rsquo;s University Rankings (Primarily Undergraduate category), for   the fifth consecutive year, and continues to evolve as one of the   country&rsquo;s leading research-intensive universities. &quot; - <a href="https://www.uleth.ca/facts">uleth fast facts</a></p>

    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p>In high school, there was a programming course which allowed me to learn about the world of coding. After high school it became clear that programming was fascinating enough for me to pursue as a career. However, I didn't want to go to a large university as this would lessen my chances of getting help from my professors if I ever needed it. Hence why I chose to get a computer science major at the <a href="https://www.uleth.ca/">University of Lethbridge.</a></p>
    <p>I've been an active Army Cadet member at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/1390armycadets/">1390 RCACC</a> since 2015 where I got to do fun Field Training Exercises (FTXs). During these FTXs, Cadets would be able to participate in to  hiking, scavenge hunts, capture the flag and more. Also there are two clubs available to Cadets, one of them I joined was the Marksmanship Club where Cadets get to use pellet guns on a 10 meter range. If the Cadet was proficient enough to group his/her pellets in a 3 cm radius they would have qualify for a Marksmanship badge. Unfortunately, obtained the badge one out of a total of 3 times so I was unable to participate in the Marksmanship competition where Cadets compete with other Cadets from different organizations like Air Cadets. </p>

    <p>When I was in my middle school years I was in the <a href="http://www.jfwa.ca/">Junior Forest Wardens</a> organization which provided numerous opportunities to enjoy some outdoor activities. Some of the activities were building an igloo, camping, and many more! The camping experiences of both Army Cadets and Junior Forest Wardens were great memories as they were all featured in a variety of weather conditions from beating hot summers to frosty winters. </p>

    <h2>My experience at the University    </h2>
    <p>Thanks to the small size of the <a href="https://www.uleth.ca/">University of Lethbridge</a> I am able to meet professors more frequently than I would otherwise be able to in larger universities. Furthermore, the small class size allows for more opportunities for students to get recognized by their professors in-class which provides an excellent opportunity for building resume contacts. Thanks to all these factors my experience at this lovely university has progressed positively and in relatively stress free manner relative to having to live in larger universities like those in Calgary to compete  against other students for the professors time.</p>
